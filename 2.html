  <h2>Approach</h2>

  <p style="margin-top:40px;">To measure social inequalities in news consumption we use data from the 2018 Digital News Report survey in the United Kingdom. Research was conducted by YouGov using an online questionnaire at the end of January/ beginning of February 2018. The data were weighted to targets based on census/industry accepted data on age, gender and region to represent the total population of the UK. The sample is re ective of the population that has access to the internet. More details on the method are reported in Newman et al. (2018).1</p>

  <p>To examine social inequality in news consumption online and o ine, we focus on the number of news sources respondents say they use on a weekly basis, as an indicator of the volume and variety of their news use, and on respondents’ social grade. We focus on the UK as an example of a media environment historically characterised by a combination of strong private publishers and widely-used independent public service media, and as a market with several prominent digital-born news providers with signi cant reach. The social dimensions of news use will di er from country to country, but we would suggest social inequality may be even greater in countries with less of a tradition of popular tabloid newspapers and less widely used public service media (previous research has suggested especially the latter can reduce information inequality, see e.g. Aalberg and Curran (2012)).</p>

  <p>For news consumption, we created two variables measuring the number of news sources used online and o ine. For the UK, there are questions for the use of 28 o ine news brands, and two questions about ‘other local/regional newspapers’, as well as ‘other newspapers or foreign brands’. For the online environment, we use questions on 32 online news brands in the UK, as well as two broader questions about ‘other local news websites’, or ‘other online sites from outside the UK’. Respondents also had the opportunity to write-in o ine and online news sources that were not on the list.</p>

  <p>For social grade, survey respondents from YouGov’s panel are classi ed based on the Market Research Society (MRS)2. Social grade is a widely used classi cation in market research and social science research in the UK. The classi cation is based on the occupation level. Respondents were asked approxinately 15 questions about the occupation of the chief income earner in their household. Based on these answers, respondents were classi ed to A – E categories, where A classi cation is ‘higher managerial, administrative and professional’ and E classi cation denotes ‘state pensioners, casual and lowest grade workers, unemployed with state bene ts only’. For the purposes of this study, we grouped respondents into two classi cations, denoting ‘higher’ (ABC1) and ‘lower’ (C2DE) social grade.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that while social grade is an important classi cation on the socio-economic level, it only re ects some aspects of social inequality. Beyond occupation and its relation to status and income, we hope further research will examine inequalities associated with, for example, age, gender, or ethnicity.</p>
