  <h2>Foreword</h2>

  <p style="margin-top:40px;"><strong>Social inequalities</strong> have always shaped <u><a href="https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2018-10/Kalogeropolous%20-%20Social%20Inequality%20in%20News%20FINAL.pdf" title="Social Inequalities in News
  Consumption" target="_blank">news consumption</a></u>, and as we move from a relatively low choice offine media environment to a high choice online media environment with more intense competition for attention, social inequalities in news consumption may increase.</p>

  <p>Previous studies have shown that the expansion of media choice offline results in the (information) rich getting richer while the (information) poor get poorer as those who are most interested consume more news, whereas those who are less interested increasingly tune out of news (Prior, 2005). Research has also found that the choices individual news users make are related to their social status (Lindell, 2017).</p>

  <p>This factsheet focuses on social inequalities in news consumption in the UK to address the question of whether inequality is increasing as we move to a more digital media environment. Based on survey data on o ine and online news consumption and taking into account individual di erences in social grade, we  nd that:</p>

  <p>• News consumption is more unequally distributed in the UK than income is, measured on the basis of the number of news sources used on a weekly basis. According to the OECD, the Gini coe cient for income in the UK was .36 in 2015. For o ine news consumption, we calculate it at .42, and for online news consumption an even higher .55.</p>

  <p>• Online news consumption is more unequally distributed than o ine news consumption. One in four individuals do not consume any news online (25%), while only 13% of respondents do not consume any news o ine.</p>

  <p>• There is greater social inequality in online news consumption than in o ine news consumption. Whereas higher social grade individuals and lower social grade individuals use the same number of sources o ine on average, lower social grade individuals use signi cantly fewer online sources on average.</p>

  <p>• A key di erence between how higher social grade and lower social grade individuals access news online is in terms of direct discovery (going to the websites or apps of news organisations). Lower social grade individuals are signi cantly less likely to go direct to news providers, whereas lower and higher social grade individuals are equally likely to rely on distributed forms of discovery (relying on social media, search engines, and the like).</p>

  <p>• Comparing the reach of individual brands o ine and online across di erent social grades, a number of UK news organisations, including tabloid newspapers and some television channels, have signi cantly higher reach o ine with lower social grade individuals than with higher social grade individuals, just as others, like up-market newspapers, have higher reach amongst higher social grade individuals than lower social grade individuals. Strikingly, however, none of the brands we analyse here have higher reach online with lower social grade individuals, while many have much wider reach with higher social grade individuals.</p>

  <p>Our analysis suggests that social inequality in news consumption is already high, that it is likely to increase as we continue to move to a more digital media environment, and that distributed forms of discovery are currently particularly important for news discovery amongst lower social grade individuals, whereas going directly to news organisations online is more the province of higher social grade individuals. Even as there is growing attention to the increasingly visible political polarisation in some people’s news use, we would suggest it is at least as important to pay attention to the less visible but at least as important growing social inequality in news use.</p>
