  <p style="margin-top:40px;">To provide an overall estimate of social inequalities in o ine and online news consumption, we use the Gini coe cient, a measure of statistical dispersion which is typically used to measure income inequalities in a population. Higher Gini coe cient denotes higher inequalities. A Gini of 1 denotes maximum inequality (e.g. an individual having all the resources in a country while the rest have none) while a Gini coe cient of 0 denotes equality to the point where all subjects have the same values (e.g. the same income for everyone).</p>

  <p>PUsing the Gini coe cient to measure inequalities in the number of sources UK news users consumed, we calculate it at .55 for the number of the online sources and .42 for the number of o ine news sources3. These  ndings suggest that the online news environment is more unequal than the o ine one, and that news consumption is more unequally distributed in the UK than income is. (The Gini coe cient for income inequality in the UK in 2015 was .36 while in the US it was estimated at .394.) While the analogy to income inequality is imperfect (it is easier for an individual to choose to use more sources of news than it is to make more money) we, in line with other researchers (e.g. Hindman, 2008),  nd it a useful measure for capturing the overall distribution.</p>

  <p>As with income, overall distributions and averages summarise a situation characterised by considerable
variation. The di erences in the number of sources UK news users use o ine and online are illustrated in Figure 1 below. More than half of online news users in the UK use zero or one news source online, while o ine it is most common to use two or three news sources per week. The median number of sources used online in the UK is 1, whereas o ine it is 2. Around a fourth of UK news users do not get news online, while 87% of news users consume news from at least one o ine news source per week.</p>

<p>Di erences in how many sources of news people use online are based on individuals’ interest in news, but also clearly associated with their social grade. While there are no signi cant di erences between the number of news brands consumed by higher social grade individuals and lower social grade ones o ine, we  nd much greater di erences online, as illustrated in Figure 2 (see p.4). Higher social grade individuals use signi cantly more online news sources (2.11) than lower social grade respondents (1.6)5.</p>

<p>Social inequality in online news consumption is not limited to the average number of news sources used, but also concerns how people get their news and what brands they rely on. Online news discovery can be broadly separated into direct discovery, where people go directly to a news organisation’s website or app to get news, and distributed discovery, where people come across news via an intermediary or platform (for example a social media site or a search engine), and then access stories from there. When we compare the ways in which individuals from di erent social grades access news online, the di erences are clear (Figure 3): higher social grade respondents are signi cantly more likely to go directly to news organisations than lower social grade respondents (57% to 45%), whereas both groups rely on distributed discovery in very similar ways.6</p>

<p>Di erences in news consumption along social grade lines are also clear at the brand level, both o ine and online.</p>

<p>As can be seen from Figure 4, there are brands in the UK o ine news media landscape that are more popular among higher social grade individuals (e.g. BBC Radio News or upmarket newspapers like The Times), brands that are more popular among lower social grade individuals (e.g. ITV News, tabloid newspapers like the Sun), and brands are that have similar reach across the two social grade groups (e.g. BBC TV News, the Daily Mail).</p>

<p>However, when turning to online news consumption (Figure 5, see p.6), we  nd that there was no online news brand among the 32 included in the survey that had signi cantly more users from lower social grades. Some outlets are more popular among higher social grade individuals (BBC News Online, Guardian online) and that others have a similar reach among higher and lower social grade individuals (Sun online, Mail
Online). But we  nd no online equivalent to those o ine television channels or tabloid newspapers who have successfully built a wider reach amongst lower social grades than amongst higher social grades.</p>
